======= ehecatl ~ ~ ~ ~ =========

Ehecatl is the wind god in aztec mythology but also is:

An erlang driver for read/write nfc smart cards.

======= notes ==========

ehecatl 

  was tested using nfc smart cards with block size of 4 bytes (8 bits)

  was tested using arygon nfc reader (Arygon NFC/MIFARE Plug & Play Module RS232)

  was tested using pcsc lite under CentOS 


======= how to use ===========

clone the ehecatl project from github: 	

	$ git clone https://github.com/jorgegarrido/ehecatl.git

move into ehecatl directory:

	$ cd ehecatl

compile ehecatl:

	$ make all

	(maybe warnings appear when compile, and a lib/libehecatl.so must be created)

start ehecatl:

	$ make ehecatl

	(an erlang shell must be opened)

========= starting, reading and writing on nfc smart card ============

in erlang shell:

starts the port driver ehecatl:

	> ehecatl:start().
	<0.??.0>

now, you must set a smart card near of nfc reader, when you are ready, then:

reading the smart card with ehecatl:

	> ehecatl:flush(read).
	%% here the reponse

the response will be a string in erlang, but if the block 08 is 
not writing yet, then the response will be 0

writing the smart card with ehecatl:

	> ehecatl:flush(write).
	ok

it must write the string "hola" in the block 08 in the smart card, 
now if you try read again, you will see "hola" as response of read command

==== reading smart cards when is inserted on nfc reader (automatically) ========

First open an erlang shell with the correct path:

	$ make ehecatl

In erlang shell:

starts the ehecatl application:

	> application:start(ehecatl).
	ok

now just swipe a card into nfc reader and you will see:

	> shell got <<"????">>

where ???? refers to data written in the smart card
